/**

 *
 * A context bound describes an implicit value. It is used to declare that for some type A, there is an implicit value
 * of type B[A] available.
 *
 * Syntax is basically a syntactic sugar around implicits that goes like this:
 *              def f[A : B](a: A) = g(a) // where g requires an implicit value of type B[A]
 *
 * Syntax in full, omitting the syntactic sugar would look like:
 *      def g[A : B](a: A) = h(a)
 *      def g[A](a: A)(implicit ev: B[A]) = h(a)
 *
 * Context bounds are mainly used in what has become known as typeclass pattern, as a reference to Haskellâ€™s type classes.
 * Basically, this pattern implements an alternative to inheritance by making functionality available through a sort of
 * implicit adapter pattern.  Scalaz is a library that makes heavy use of this pattern.
